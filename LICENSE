Copyright (c) 2024 Hasan Haj Hasan

The MIT License is popular among open source licenses for several reasons:

Permissive: The MIT License is very permissive. It allows users to do almost anything they want with the code, including using it for commercial purposes, without requiring them to open-source their own code.

Simple and Clear: The MIT License is short and easy to understand. It doesn't have complex legal language, making it accessible to developers and organizations.

Widely Accepted: The MIT License is widely used and accepted in the open-source community. This can make it easier for others to use and contribute to your project.

No Liability: The MIT License includes a disclaimer of liability, which can protect the project maintainer from being held liable for any damages caused by the software.

Compatibility: The MIT License is compatible with many other licenses, making it easier to combine code from different projects.

Overall, the MIT License is a good choice for many open-source projects due to its simplicity, permissiveness, and wide acceptance in the community.
